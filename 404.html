<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 align="center"><b>“404”</b></h2>
<p align="center">
It is said,“To err is human,”<br>
That quote from alt.times.lore,<br>
Alas, you have made an error,<br>
So I say,“404.”<br>
<br>
Double-check your URL,<br>
  As we all have heard before.<br>
  You ask for an invalid filename,<br>
  And I respond,“404.”<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps you made a typo —<br>
  Your fingers may be sore —<br>
But until you type it right,<br>
You'll only get 404.

<p align="center">
Maybe you followed a bad link,<br>
Surfing a foreign shore;<br>
You'll just have to tell that author<br>
About this 404.

<p align="center">
I'm just a lowly server<br>
(Who likes to speak in metaphor),<br>
So for a request that I don't know,<br>
I must return 404.

<p align="center">
Be glad I'm not an old mainframe<br>
That might just dump its core,<br>
Because then you'd get a ten-meg file<br>
Instead of this 404.

<p align="center">
I really would like to help you,<br>
But I don't know what you're looking for,<br>
And since I don't know what you want,<br>
I give you 404.

<p align="center">
Remember Poe, insane with longing<br>
For his tragically lost Lenore.<br>
Instead, you quest for files.<br>
Quoth the Raven,“404!”
